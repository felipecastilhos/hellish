This project has been **ARCHIEVED**

I've migrate my side projects to Godot and didn't try to redo this project.
I was using this project to create some unity tooling and improve my design workflow.

A game about being a bugged jumping mage.

This is just a toy project to practice on how to develop a plataform game in unity.

### Assets
All assets are flipped or original assets from [itch.io](https://itch.io/) and [OpenGameArt](opengameart.org). At the time I was just focusing on practice that I lost all links for the assets to mention. If you ever know the artist related to the asset, please reach me out so I can add it in here.
